* What qualifies a service provider to be “FinOps Certified Service Provider”?
* What KPIs are used to measure quality and success in Cloud Financial Management?
* What skills do teams need to hire into FinOps roles? What are example jobs descriptions?
* Managing the FinOps Landscape: https://github.com/finopsfoundation/finops-landscape
